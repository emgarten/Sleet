# What is Sleet?

Sleet is a static NuGet package feed generator.

* **Serverless**. Create static feeds directly on *Azure Storage*, *Amazon S3* or another S3 compatible storage. No compute required.
* **Cross platform**. Sleet is built in .NET, it can run on *.NET Framework*, *Mono*, or [dotnet CLI](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)
* **Fast.** Static feeds are created using the [NuGet v3 feed format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/overview).
* **Symbol server.** Assemblies and pdb files from packages are automatically indexed and provided as a [symbol server](doc/symbol-server.md).
* **Simple.** Sleet is a simple command line tool that can add, remove, and update packages.
* **Flexible.** Feeds can be written to disk and hosted with a web server to support authentication. Use the command line tool or a library to run Sleet programmatically.
