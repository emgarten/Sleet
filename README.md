# What is Sleet?

Sleet is a static NuGet package feed generator.

* **Serverless**. Create static feeds directly on *Azure Storage*, *Amazon S3* or another S3 compatible storage. No compute required.
* **Cross platform**. Sleet is built in .NET, it can run on *.NET Framework*, *Mono*, or [dotnet CLI](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)
* **Fast.** Static feeds are created using the [NuGet v3 feed format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/overview).
* **Simple.** Sleet is a simple command line tool that can add, remove, and update packages.
* **Flexible.** Configuration and credentials can be set using files, env vars, command line args, or AWS specific patterns to support a variety of workflows and CI builds.

## Why use static feeds?

* Package binaries are typically kept outside of git repos, static feeds provide a long term storage solution that can be paired with checked in code.
* NuGet feeds are typically read for restore far more than they are updated.
* Cloud storage accounts are a cheap and secure way to share nupkgs for public feeds.
* You keep full control of your packages.

## Getting Sleet

### Manually getting sleet.exe (Windows and Mono)
1. Download the latest SleetExe nupkg from [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SleetExe)
1. Extract *tools/Sleet.exe* to a local folder and run it.

### Install dotnet global tool
1. `dotnet tool install -g sleet`
1. `sleet` should now be on your *PATH*

## CI builds

CI builds are located on the following NuGet feed:

## History

Sleet was created to achieve the original goals of the NuGet v3 feed format: Provide maximum availability and performance for NuGet restore by using only static files.

The v3 feed format was designed to do all compute when pushing a new package since updates are infrequent compared to the number of times a package is read for restore. Static files also remove the need to run a specific server to host the feed, allowing a simple file service to handle it.
