# Creating an Amazon S3 feed

This guide is used to setup a new feed hosted on Amazon S3 storage.

## Creating a config for Amazon S3 feed

Create a `sleet.json` config file to define a new package feed hosted on Amazon S3 storage.

``sleet createconfig --s3``

Edit `sleet.json` using your editor of choice to set the url of your s3 bucket and access key.

``notepad sleet.json``

### Using an AWS credentials file

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "feed",
      "type": "s3",
      "path": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket-feed/",
      "profileName": "sleetProfile",
      "bucketName": "my-bucket-feed",
      "region": "us-west-2"
    }
  ]
}
```

For details on creating a credentials file go [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v2/developer-guide/net-dg-config-creds.html#creds-file)

### Using accessKeyId and secretAccessKey in sleet.json

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "feed",
      "type": "s3",
      "path": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket-feed/",
      "bucketName": "my-bucket-feed",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "accessKeyId": "IAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
      "secretAccessKey": "IAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
    }
  ]
}
```

This example specifies the access key id and secret key directly in sleet.json.

### Using an EC2 instance profile

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "feed",
      "type": "s3",
      "path": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket-feed/",
      "bucketName": "my-bucket-feed",
      "region": "us-west-2"
    }
  ]
}
```

To use [AWS environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) create an s3 feed config without an *accessKeyId* or *secretAccessKey*. Sleet will attempt to automatically configure the feed based on the environment.

### Using S3 compatible storage

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "feed",
      "type": "s3",
      "path": "https://nupkg.website.yandexcloud.net/",
      "bucketName": "nupkg",
      "serviceURL": "https://storage.yandexcloud.net",
      "accessKeyId": "IAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
      "secretAccessKey": "IAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
    }
  ]
}
```

To use S3 compatible storage create an s3 feed config with *serviceURL* instead of *region*.

### Additional feed settings

Help on additional feed settings such as *baseURI* and *feedSubPath* can be found under [Sleet client settings](client-settings.md)

## Adding packages

Add packages to the feed with the push command, this can be used with either a path to a single nupkg or a folder of nupkgs.

``sleet push d:\nupkgsToPush``

## Initializing the feed

For a new feed the first push will do the following:

* Create the bucket and set the policy to public read-only
* Initialize the feed with the default settings

If the bucket already exists the policy will *not* be modified. Private feeds should set up the bucket before pushing for the first time.

To create a feed with custom feed settings, such as with a catalog or symbols feed, use the `init` first.

## Using the feed

Add the feed as a source to your `NuGet.Config` file. In the example above the package source URL is ``https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket-feed/index.json``

## Creating a private S3 feed

Private feeds can be created by creating a lambda function to authenticate clients. 

For help setting up S3 go [here](http://kynatro.com/blog/2018/01/03/a-step-by-step-guide-to-creating-a-password-protected-s3-bucket/)

In *sleet.json* set *baseURI* for the feed to the CloudFront address, this will write the CloudFront URI to the feed json files instead of the restricted S3 bucket which the client cannot access.
